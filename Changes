	- START argument in both reader and writer is changed to FLAGS;
	  NGXE_START is a flag for automatic start;
	- reader and writer are more smart now and can start and stop
	  depending on the write buffer;
	- added dual calls to stop and start reader and writer in 
	  a single perl -> xsub call but might not be needed anymore;
	- a few automated tests for basic functionality;
	- bugfix: failed connect to localhost was crashing, required 
	  peer->name to log an error, which was not used at all;
	- fix: ngxe_server was not returning an error if port was already
	  taken;
