Performance:

  - ngxe_reader_stop_writer_start() and ngxe_reader_start_writer_stop()
    to avoid unnecessary perl->xsub call

  - create another type of caller to avoid unnecessary perl->xsub
    calls, ngxe_reader_server() or something that handles reads and 
    switches to the writer after return if there is some data in
    the output buffer and than switches back and awaits for new 
    data in the read buffer, kind of reader's point of control
    and maybe do the same with the writer's point of control 

General:

  - improve documentation

  - consider cleanup callbacks instead of return on error

  - ngxe_http_server()

  - ngxe_resolve()


Someday:

  - rewrite nginx ./configure scripts to use MakeMaker and to be able 
    to build nginx on windows and other platforms along with the 
    Nginx::Engine
