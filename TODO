Performance:

  - use FLAGS to accelerate required behaviours (parsing HTTP, etc.)

General:

  - improve documentation

  - consider cleanup callbacks instead of return on error

  - ngxe_http_server()

  - ngxe_resolver()


Someday:

  - rewrite nginx ./configure scripts to use MakeMaker and to be able 
    to build nginx on windows and other platforms along with the 
    Nginx::Engine
